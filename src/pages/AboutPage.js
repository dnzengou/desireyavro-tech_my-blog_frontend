    <h1>ME IN A NUTSHELL</h1>

        management expertise, experience working with multidisciplinary teams at large corporate, government, early and seed

    </p>
    <p>
        While I am currently learning about Complexity Theory, diving into maths and programming (mostly in Matlab, python or C++) 
        to simulate complex adaptive systems – such as the climate, ecosystems, the society as a whole, governments etc. 
        to drive data-backed decision making for, among other areas, policy writing, sustainable product development, hunman-centred innovation 
        – I am open and willing to take on new ventures, ideally for a stable long-term collaboration.

        What drives me? Challenging projects, opportunities of learning, travels, nature. And fun things ;-)
