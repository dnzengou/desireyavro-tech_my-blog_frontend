    <p>
        Multinational Industrial engineer and business management educated, experienced consultant for technology-driven innovation, 
        I love the diversity of my various missions as much as the complex challenges they often encompass.
        What drives me? Challenging and fun projects, learn fun and new stuff, building up on or improving existing ones, travels :)
        Currently, I help innovative organizations within my network to solve technology and business challenges with a combination of design thinking, lean, science of modeling and (predictive) analytics, as well as common sense, and intuition. Ensuring training/coaching. 
    <h2>How can I help? </h2>
